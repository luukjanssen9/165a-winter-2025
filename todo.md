# THINGS TO DO:
## Milestone 1 Parts:

### Data Model: 
store the schema and instance for each table in columnar form.

### Bufferpool Management: 
maintain data in memory.

### Query Interface: 
to offer data manipulation and querying capabilities such as select, insert, update, and delete of a single key along with a simple aggregation query, namely, to return the summation of a single column for a range of keys.


## Things to do: Implement the APIs
one team should focus on the table stuff
- ~~Table class~~
    -  ~~"core of our relational storage functionality" (idk, it doesnt tell us what to implement specifically)~~
- ~~Database class~~
    -  ~~create table function~~
    -  ~~drop table function~~

another team should focus on the page stuff
- ~~Page class~~
    -  ~~keep in mind that base pages and tail pages should be indentical from the hardware's POV~~
- ~~Index class~~
    -  ~~create_index function~~
    -  ~~drop_index function~~

query requires tables and pages to be done, we should save it for last. it should be relatively simple once we understand the structure of the system
- Query class
    -  ~~select function~~
        - select_version function
    -  ~~insert function~~
    -  update function
    -  ~~delete function~~
    -  sum function

- ~~config.py~~
    -  ~~"centralized storage for all the configuration options and the constant values used in the code" ~~
- be able to run main.py
    -  used for the autograder

## Extra things to implement for an A+:
- indexing functionality (primary and/or secondary indexes) (using hash tables or trees)
- experimental analysis/graphs
- extended query capabilities
